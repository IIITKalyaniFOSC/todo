# What are the things we should do next?
Free and Open Source Community just started, we would love to work on great things __together!__ 
  
Use __Issues__ section to share your ideas/suggestions for the FOSC community. Would you like to work on building something cool with others in our community? What events would you like FOSC to host in the coming academic year? Any constructive criticism(not for an individual but for the overall community) can also go there. Use the issues section to start a discussion around your idea.
