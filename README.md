# What are the things we should do next?
It has been only a few months since the birth of Free and Open Source Community, we would love to work on great things __together!__ 
  
Use __Issues__ section to share your ideas/suggestions for the FOSC community. Would you like to work on building something cool with others in our community? What events would you like FOSC to host in the coming academic year? Any constructive criticism(not for an individual but for the overall community) can also go there. Use the issues section to start a discussion around your idea.

## Current Undertakings
- [ ] Hackathon website
- [ ] Gymkhana blog

## Accomplished
We believe that __development of a software is a continuous process__, and it never gets over. Whenever we achieve a minimum viability for a community developed software, we consider it accomplished and move it to this section, but the work on it never ends. __Feel free to contribute new features or report bug on any of the softwares listed below.__
